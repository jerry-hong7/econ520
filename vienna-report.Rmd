## Background: Vienna, Austria Accommodations

```{r image, echo=FALSE}}
knitr::include_graphics("docs/vienna.jpg")
```


Our point of interest in this report is to explore and find good deals among hotels, hospitals, and other types of accommodations across Vienna, Austria. The data set contains information, such as price, type, and customer ratings of 428 accommodations in Vienna. The data set is from the website Booking.com and was collected in 2017. The primary objective is uncover relationships between price and the other variables, in hopes gain a better understanding on finding good deals.    

## Data Exploration

Let's start by loading the data set and taking a look at the first few rows and a summary of the data set. This is a processed data set where we have to modify the data types of some variables in order to do the appropriate analysis. For example, the `guestreviewsrating` variable was of type character, so we convert it to numeric type. This data set also includes a couple new variables that can complement our analysis. For example, we created a variable to better differentiate the type of accommodation.

```{r load data, echo=FALSE}
vienna <- read_csv("data/processed/vienna_data.csv")
```

```{r head, echo=FALSE}
head(vienna)
```

```{r summary, echo=FALSE}
summary(vienna)
```

## Exploring Relationships with Price

We will start by exploring the relationship between price and the other variables in the data set. We will use scatter plots to visualize the relationships. 

```{r scatter plots, echo=FALSE}
